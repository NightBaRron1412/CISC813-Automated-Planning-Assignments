# CISC813: Automated Planning Assignments

This repository contains my **CISC813: Automated Planning** assignments, showcasing various planning paradigms and domain modeling techniques. Each assignment folder includes all necessary files and documentation to understand, reproduce, and evaluate the planning scenarios.

These assignments were completed as part of my **Master of Applied Science (MASc.) in Electronics and Computer Engineering** at **Queen's University**.

---

## Repository Structure

Each assignment folder contains the following files:

- **Domain File**: The domain model, written in an appropriate language (e.g., PDDL, RDDL, HDDL) depending on the assignment requirements.
- **Problem File**: The specific instance or problem description for the domain.
- **Plan File (if applicable)**: The solution or plan generated by the planner.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the assignment, including details about the domain, problem, and how to execute the planner.

- **Description**: Models epidemic spread across interconnected regions with vaccination, hospital capacity, and movement restrictions.

### Assignment 5: Electronics Manufacturing Domain in PDDL
- **Description**: Simulates processes in an electronics manufacturing facility, including assembly, testing, and packaging.

### Assignment 6: Multi-Vessel Chemical Process Domain in PDDL
- **Description**: Guides vessels through heating and cooling phases while minimizing processing time.

### Assignment 7: Warehouse Logistics HTN Planning in HDDL
- **Description**: Optimizes warehouse operations using multiple robots and Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning.

### Assignment 8: Undercity Intrigue: Epistemic Planning Inspired by Arcane
- **Description**: Models character dynamics and intrigue in a narrative inspired by *Arcane*, with epistemic reasoning.

### Assignment 9: Space Colony Builder in PDDL
- **Description**: Simulates construction and resource management in a space colony using STRIPS-based PDDL.

## How to Run

To run any planning problem:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NightBaRron1412/CISC813-Automated-Planning-Assignments.git
   cd CISC813-Automated-Planning
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific assignment folder:
   ```bash
   cd AssignmentX
   ```
3. Execute the planner with the provided domain and problem files:
   ```bash
   <planner_command> domain_file problem_file
   ```
   Replace `<planner_command>`, `domain_file`, and `problem_file` with the appropriate commands and filenames for the assignment. Refer to the `README.md` file within each assignment folder for specific details and instructions.
